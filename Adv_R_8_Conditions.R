# 8.2 Signalling conditions -----------------------------------------------

# There are three conditions that you can signal in code: errors, warnings,
# and messages.

# Errors are the most severe; they indicate that there is no way for a function
# to continue and execution must stop.

# Warnings fall somewhat in between errors and message, and typically indicate
# that something has gone wrong but the function has been able to at least
# partially recover.

# Messages are the mildest; they are way of informing users that some action
# has been performed on their behalf.

# There is a final condition that can only be generated interactively:
# an interrupt, which indicates that the user has interrupted execution by
# pressing Escape, Ctrl + Break, or Ctrl + C (depending on the platform).

stop("This is what an error looks like!")
warning("This is what a warning looks like")
message("This is what a message looks like")
